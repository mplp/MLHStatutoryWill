question: |
  Welcome to Michigan Legal Help’s Do-It-Yourself Michigan Statutory Will tool. 
subquestion: |
  This tool will help you figure out if the Michigan statutory will is right for you and, if so, help you prepare one. 

  You will be asked a series of questions about you, your family, and your property. If you are eligible to use this form, your personalized Michigan statutory will with instructions will be ready to print after you answer all the questions.

  It will take 10 to 30 minutes to answer all the questions.

id: intro_screen_2
question: |
  There are many types of wills you can prepare.  
subquestion: |
  The Michigan statutory will is a simple will. Use this tool to create a Michigan statutory will.
  
  This tool is not right for you if you:

  - are under 18 years old
  - do not live in Michigan
  - want to leave any single piece of property to more than one person
  - want to name different guardians for each of your minor children
  - are a Native American whose estate may include trust lands
  
  
  Click **Continue** to begin  
continue button field: intro_screen_2

id: intro_screen_3
question: |
  The Michigan statutory will has a set inheritance structure that assumes you want to leave most of your property to your closest relatives.
 
subquestion: |
  Under the terms of this will, if you are married when you die, your spouse will inherit almost everything you own. 
  
  If you aren’t married when you sign the will, or if your spouse dies before you do, your children will inherit most of your property in equal shares. 
  
  Your property will be distributed to extended family members if no spouse, children, or descendants survive you. 
  
  If you want more flexibility in distributing your property, you may want to talk to a lawyer to help you with your will. Use the [Guide to Legal Help](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/guide-to-legal-help)  to find lawyers or legal services in your area.

id: intro_screen_4
question: |
  You will be asked to name a **personal representative** for your estate. 
subquestion: |
  Your personal representative is the person who will make sure your property is distributed according to your wishes. 
  
  This should be a responsible person that you trust, and ideally someone who lives close to you. 
  It could also be a bank. Make your choice before you begin. It’s a good idea to ask the person if they are willing and able to serve as personal representative before you make a final choice.
  
  If you have children under 18, you will also be asked to name a **guardian** to care for them and a **conservator** to manage their money. Again, make your choices and get their contact information before you begin.

id: leave_up_gifts
question: |
  You can leave up to two gifts of cash in your will.
subquestion: |
  Think carefully about whether to leave cash gifts. These cash gifts will be paid "off the top" of your estate no matter how much money you have when you die. For example, you may decide today to leave $5,000 to a friend or charity, and the rest of your estate to your children. You may then end up spending all but $4,000 of your savings before you die. In that case, the friend or charity would receive the $4,000, and your children would receive nothing.

  Each gift can be left to one person or charity. If you want to leave more than two cash gifts, or any cash gift jointly to more than one person, you can’t use this tool or the statutory will to do so. You may want to contact a lawyer to help you with your will. Use the [Guide to Legal Help](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/guide-to-legal-help)  to find lawyers or legal services in your area.

question: |
  You can choose to leave gifts of specific personal or household items to anyone you wish. 
subquestion: |
  Such items may include jewelry, books, clothing, vehicles, appliances, and furniture. Personal and household items do not include land, homes, bank accounts, stocks, or bonds.


  You can execute your will without having this list prepared. You can prepare the list at any time. You can include as many or as few items on the list as you wish.

question: |
  You can update the list as often as you want. 
subquestion: |
  Sign and date the bottom of each new list that you make. If you don’t sign and date the bottom of the list, your wishes may not be honored. If you make a list of personal property, it becomes part of your will. Keep it with your will.


  Anything not on this list becomes the "residue" of your estate. Your spouse or other heirs will inherit the residue, which is all the property you do not specifically list in your will.

---
id: residue_status
question: |
  Everything you own that you have not already listed is called the residue of your estate. 
subquestion: |
  The cash gifts you named and the property you put on the list are **not** included in the residue. Those will be taken from your estate before the residue is distributed.


  Under this will, the residue of your estate will go to your children in equal shares. If any of your children died before you, but had children who are still living (your grandchildren), those descendants get equal shares of what your deceased child would have inherited.
  
continue button field: residue_status
---
id: residue_status_heirs
question: |
  If no spouse, children, or descendants of your children survive you, the residue will be distributed to your other relatives. 
subquestion: |
  These other relatives are called your "heirs."

  Your heirs are determined by law, the same way they would be if you died without a will. First, your parents or their descendants (your siblings, nieces, or nephews) would inherit. If none of those people survive you, then your grandparents or their descendants (your aunts, uncles, or cousins) would inherit. If the court can’t identify any surviving relatives in these categories, the residue of your estate will go to the state of Michigan.
  
continue button field: residue_status_heirs
---
id: residue_status_stepchild
question: |
  If no spouse, child, or descendent of your child is living when you die.
subquestion: |
  You can choose to leave the residue of your estate entirely to your heirs (parents, siblings, nieces, uncles, etc.), or to divide it evenly between your heirs and your spouse’s heirs. If you have stepchildren, this is the only way they will inherit from you, using the statutory will.

  You can only choose one of these options. If you want to distribute your property differently, you may want to contact a lawyer to help you with your will. Use the [Guide to Legal Help](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/guide-to-legal-help)  to find lawyers or legal services in your area.

id: personal_representatives
question: |
  The Michigan statutory will requires you to choose a **personal representative.**
subquestion: |
  Your personal representative is the person who will make sure your property is distributed according to your wishes. The personal representative also pays any final bills you have when you die, usually by using or selling property from your estate.

  Pick a responsible person you trust to be your personal representative. You may want to choose someone who lives close to you. It’s a good idea to ask the person if they are willing and able to serve as personal representative before you make a final choice.

  You can name a guardian to take care of your children until they turn 18.

  If your children’s other parent outlives you and is able to care for them, that parent will likely get custody instead of your chosen guardian.


  If the other parent dies before you, has had their parental rights terminated, or is unable to care for your children, the guardian you chose can accept guardianship by filing with the probate court.
